Here are my comments, take them or toss them as you see fit.

In reading through this, not sure why the gender of the President is specifically called out "He/She" when it is not called out elsewhere, I would suggest eliminating that. (Article III (a))

Who is responsible for ensuring the continued tax status of the club. I don't know if it's been rectified, but I believe - at least last year - the club had lost it's 501(c)3 status.

Article VI: 
It shall be the duty of the Nominating Committee to consider candidates representing a range of members including female, male, social and competitive curlers.

Why call out specific genders? (especially as we enter a more fluid gender world) Unless we are trying to specifically achieve a certain ratio. 

Article VIII - (e) "..has vacated his/her office" could be changed to "their"

Article XV - again the gender comment.  Also, why "Governor"?  It's not used elsewhere in the document.

I've been through a couple bylaws rewrites recently, so I thought I'd provide some thoughts:

I'm not sure History helps any more. Most of it is irrelevant. Some of it is wrong, e.g. Brae Burn no longer exists. And do we really want people from Weston scheduling a rental they don't have to pay for? In its place a mission statement would be customary. Our 501c3 certification may speak to this.

"Corporation" should be defined.

Article I " Do the articles of association need a review, too? My recollection is that these were drafted when the members of Broomstones, Inc. were the founding clubs, not individuals.

Article II Second sentence makes no sense
Shouldn't officers be required to be members of the club?

Article III Allowing Board to appoint officers is unusual
Books of account do not belong to the Treasurer

Article IV 1 usually requires more than a majority. As written, 4 Board members could remove all officers.
3 and 4 are unusually broad......usually these major decisions require a membership vote, often more than a majority. And do we want the president to have these powers between Board meetings?.

Article V SVP presiding is unusual, but perhaps not harmful

Article VII Add telephonic participation? Votes by email?

Other bylaws I've seen all have a conflict of interest policy and some have a code of conduct.

Hope this helps. It would be great if a club member who's an attorney would volunteer to help you with this.

Your bylaws do not mention any committees other than the executive committee (delegate some responsibilities to buildings and grounds, ice committee, bar?

article 1 (a) (2) - first problem  – member without voting privileges can be a member of the Board and no voting privileges (or the reverse) as the wording stands now. You must replace or with and (and eliminate the semicolons in (1) and (2)).

And where is the Agreement of Association that we subscribe to (top of page 2)?


Article 15 - use of Governor was never defined prior to this. Use Officer (or member).

My suggestion is to include the representatives to national and regional curling organizations, being USCA, USWCA, and GNCC on the Board of Directors, probably as ex officio members.
I think it is important to the growth of the sport to have communication from the national/regional levels and the local clubs.



-- email 5 : regarding diversity of board.

Is this a specific quota?  That is, must there be at least one of each of these four specific classes?  Is there a reason we don’t include other measures of diversity, such as SES, race, ethnicity, town of residence, etc.?

Revised: Suggestion to use Restated.

I agree - there are some sections that probably wouldn't pass muster if they were challenged by someone or some outside group. We are a corporation - have these bylaws been passed on to the "government person responsible for overseeing corporations?"

In the end, the bylaws must be approved by the entire membership, which can be done (2/3 voting in favor) only by polling the entire membership. What happens with non votes, for example? Are they counted as no votes, or does one assume that 2/3 of those voting in favor can approve the bylaws changes? The bylaws state those present at a duly called meeting. Why not a letter ballot to the entire membership? I can pursue these and several other issues in the Bylaws and give you my input before your call for a meeting of the membership (April time?). You do realize that a meeting of the memberships is NOT a Board of Director's meeting. You will have to call another meeting or send letter ballots out to pass any of these bylaws changes. 

Reiterating my earlier comment about active members/those who have voting capacity - there is no clear statement in the bylaws on how one becomes an active/voting member except by adhering to the Articles of Association (again, where are these).

The USWCA has adopted "mail or electronic transmission" which covers email, text and anything else you can possible think of… maybe Tweets????
  
We also the USWCA fiscal year to define one curling season.

USWCA focuses more on kicking Clubs out that don’t pay their dues…. not inappropriate behavior - that’s a club-specific problem… but here’s what the USWCA Bylaws say:

(f) Any member club, individual club member, Member-at-Large or Associate Member failing to uphold the standards or purposes of these Bylaws may be suspended by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all voting members of the Board of Directors, provided due notice of the charge against it/her was given and an opportunity to be heard in its/her own defense was provided.

(1) Any suspended member (club, individual, Member-at-Large or Associate Member) shall be eligible for re-instatement after a waiting period of two years from the date of suspension and shall upon application fulfill all the requirements of a new member applicant.

(2) The suspended member (as outlined above) shall be liable for any delinquent dues accumulated prior to the date of suspension and may not be re-instated until these are paid.

Any references to “notices mailed” should include “or emailed”, unless emailing is now a legally accepted substitute for mailing.
 
ARTICLE VIII - Meetings of the Corporation
(a) The annual meeting of the corporation shall be held no later than fifteen days after the end of the fiscal year and at such place in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors, and shall be for the purpose of the election of officers and receiving reports and for any other business that may arise.
 
I had asked Bill about this in the past, and he interpreted this to mean that our Annual Meeting technically needs to be held in the first 15 days of June. We have been holding them around the first week of May for as long as I can remember and ideally would like to hold them in mid-April.
 
Suggested Change: (a) The annual meeting of the corporation shall be held no later than forty-five days after the end of thecurling season and at such place in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as may be fixed by the Board of Directors, and shall be for the purpose of the election of officers and receiving reports and for any other business that may arise. (We would probably need to define “Curling Season” in order to use that term. We could just set a date range of “shall be held between the First Day of April and the Last Day of May”)
 
Jeff, the following goes to our discussion about requiring two-thirds of the membership to change the by-laws. You felt it was only 35 members, based on the requirement for Meetings of the Corporation, but this article sets the bar higher for changing the by-laws.
 
ARTICLE XIII - Amendments
As revised May 10, 2008 These By-laws may be amended at any regular or special meeting of the corporation by a two-thirds vote of the members of the corporation with power to vote present at the 
meeting, in person or by proxy, provided that such amendment, or the substance thereof, is stated in the notice of such meeting. 
 
Code of Conduct and Expulsion of Members.
We now have a Code of Conduct, and a procedure to review grievances and expel members, does that need to be included or is that covered under Article I – Section C?
Membership Descriptions, Dues and Fees shall be determined by the Board of Directors and reviewed on an annual basis. Failure
to pay membership dues or other club charges for a period of two months after the same are payable, or conduct which the Board 
of Directors deems inconsistent with the best interest of the corporation shall constitute grounds for termination of membership by vote of the Board of Directors.
