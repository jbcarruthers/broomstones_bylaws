Here are my comments, take them or toss them as you see fit.

In reading through this, not sure why the gender of the President is specifically called out "He/She" when it is not called out elsewhere, I would suggest eliminating that. (Article III (a))

Who is responsible for ensuring the continued tax status of the club. I don't know if it's been rectified, but I believe - at least last year - the club had lost it's 501(c)3 status.

Article VI: 
It shall be the duty of the Nominating Committee to consider candidates representing a range of members including female, male, social and competitive curlers.

Why call out specific genders? (especially as we enter a more fluid gender world) Unless we are trying to specifically achieve a certain ratio. 

Article VIII - (e) "..has vacated his/her office" could be changed to "their"

Article XV - again the gender comment.  Also, why "Governor"?  It's not used elsewhere in the document.

I've been through a couple bylaws rewrites recently, so I thought I'd provide some thoughts:

I'm not sure History helps any more. Most of it is irrelevant. Some of it is wrong, e.g. Brae Burn no longer exists. And do we really want people from Weston scheduling a rental they don't have to pay for? In its place a mission statement would be customary. Our 501c3 certification may speak to this.

"Corporation" should be defined.

Article I " Do the articles of association need a review, too? My recollection is that these were drafted when the members of Broomstones, Inc. were the founding clubs, not individuals.

Article II Second sentence makes no sense
Shouldn't officers be required to be members of the club?

Article III Allowing Board to appoint officers is unusual
Books of account do not belong to the Treasurer

Article IV 1 usually requires more than a majority. As written, 4 Board members could remove all officers.
3 and 4 are unusually broad......usually these major decisions require a membership vote, often more than a majority. And do we want the president to have these powers between Board meetings?.

Article V SVP presiding is unusual, but perhaps not harmful

Article VII Add telephonic participation? Votes by email?

Other bylaws I've seen all have a conflict of interest policy and some have a code of conduct.

Hope this helps. It would be great if a club member who's an attorney would volunteer to help you with this.

Your bylaws do not mention any committees other than the executive committee (delegate some responsibilities to buildings and grounds, ice committee, bar?

article 1 (a) (2) - first problem  â€“ member without voting privileges can be a member of the Board and no voting privileges (or the reverse) as the wording stands now. You must replace or with and (and eliminate the semicolons in (1) and (2)).

And where is the Agreement of Association that we subscribe to (top of page 2)?


Article 15 - use of Governor was never defined prior to this. Use Officer (or member).
