***HISTORY***

In 1967, the participants of the Weston Curling Club and the Wellesley
Curling Club, who had been curling on rented ice, elected to build a
curling facility. Both clubs wished to maintain their individual
identities and conduct business separately within the new curling space.
The founders organized Broomstones, Inc. (hereinafter known as the
Corporation) to care for the physical plant located at 138 Rice Road,
Wayland, Massachusetts. In 1978, the participants of the Brae Burn
Curling Club joined the Corporation. Each of the curling clubs held
membership in the Grand National Curling Club of America.

A new club, Broomstones Curling Club, was formed in 1992 to facilitate
the unification of all curlers at the Broomstones facility and was
granted membership in the Grand National Curling Club of America the
same year.

In 1997, the participants of Wellesley Curling Club dissolved their
organization and became members of Broomstones Curling Club. Brae Burn
and Weston Curling Clubs continued to exist as independently managed,
affiliated clubs, offering special events to their members, which
maintained their specific heritage.

In the year 2000, all dues paying members of Broomstones Inc.
automatically became members of Broomstones Curling Club. Dual
Memberships with Weston Curling Club and/or Brae Burn Curling Club are
freely encouraged. These affiliated clubs may use the Broomstones
facility, when available, for special events at no additional charge. In
an effort to product a cohesive organization which will implement
long-range strategic planning for the Corporation as a whole; the
Broomstones, Inc. Board of Directors formally became the primary
governing body.
